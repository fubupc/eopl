;; Exercise 1.26 [â˜…â˜…] `(up lst)` removes a pair of parentheses from each top-level element of `lst`.
;; If a top-level element is not a list, it is included in the result, as is. The value of
;; `(up (down lst))` is equivalent to `lst`, but `(down (up lst))` is not necessarily `lst`.
;; (See exercise 1.17.)
